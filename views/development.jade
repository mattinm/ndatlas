                        p Each Fall semester, several groups are formed combining students taking Dr. Niedzielski’s GEOG471/L Cartography & Visualization course and students from various participating departments taking his A&S499 Interdisciplinary Practicum course. Each group is responsible for telling the story of a chosen theme through maps, graphs and narratives. The project is also supported by a group of students taking Dr. Desell’s Capstone course in Computer Science who work on the technical design of the interactive atlas.

                                p During the Fall 2014 semester, there were five groups. Four groups worked on themes that are described in detail below. These groups typically consisted of 2 students from A&S499 and 2-4 students from GEOG471. The fifth group consisted of two Computer Science students working on the web design of the atlas.
                                h3 Population change in North Dakota
                                p(class="theme-description") We are studying North Dakota's population over time. We are gathering census data from statehood to the present. Maps that show population by county will be created for each census. When viewed together the maps will show the evolution of the state as its population pushed westward and concentrates into cities. Our narratives will focus on explaining the reasons behind major fluxes in North Dakota's population.

We hope to create a visual and interpretive map that can be accessed by anyone who is interested in learning about the rich cultural history of North Dakota.

Kathryn is examining the rise of Pentecostalism while Luke is focusing on Anabaptist groups, particularly the Hutterite Colonies and their unique religious identity. Together, they are also working on a narrative to show, describe and explain the overall make up of religious affiliation.

                                p(class="theme-description") We're challenged with creating the interactive, online application for the North Dakota Atlas project. Our primary goals are: (1) to create a clean, intuitive interface for the students gathering the information, maps, and narratives to easily create and maintain the atlas without needing further technical assistance; and (2) allow for the creation of interactive maps from digital data on-the-fly, allowing for the dynamic creation for maps from available data for integration with narratives.#[br]Our biggest challenges will be developing a user interface that is consistent for multiple devices and screen sizes, including phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops and integrating existing technologies and algorithms to allow for the dynamic elements of the atlas.#[br]By creating a content management system, our application can be extended to further projects and allow other schools or organizations to create their own online atlas. We look forward to helping honor North Dakota's 125th anniversary and helping with a project that has great educational and informational potential.

                                p During the Spring 2015 semester, there were five student groups with three groups continuing and expanding on themes from the previous semester. The Computer Science students continued developing the web interface with the initial basic version of the atlas website ready by the end of the semester. A fifth group consisted of two Geography students who worked on a new topic. An additional sixth group, consisting of Michael Niedzielski and Michael Jacobs, worked on mapping railroads growth and contraction over time.
                                h3 Ethnic Self-Identity
                                p(class="theme-description") The goal of the project this semester is to investigate how individuals in North Dakota self-identify with an ethnic group. We will engage in one-on-one interviews not for the purpose of making broad generalizations about each ethnic group. Rather, we want the general public to be aware that ethnicity itself is culturally constructed and something that is learned, rather than hard-wired to one’s biological make-up.

We will be looking at general causations  of abandonment across the state, and take an in depth look at why select towns across the state were settled and then abandoned. More specifically, we will choose four towns in the following counties: Grand Forks, Burleigh/Morton, Bowman/Hettinger, and Sargent, to closely examine and create a strong narrative based on the story of each of these towns. Each county was chosen so as to help represent a larger image of the state, taking in to account geographic differences and historical events that have shaped the state.

Second, Marshall Mattingly continued work on the web development. Third, Karl Bauer and Jay Sandeen, with assistance from Jacob Garibay, continued work on data collection and map design for the project.
