                            |The North Dakota Online Atlas, led by the University of North Dakota's Department of Geography in collaboration with the Departments of American Indian Studies, Anthropology, Biology, Communications, Computer Science, History, Integrated Studies, and Religious Studies, is an interdisciplinary collaborative project that seeks to develop an online atlas of North Dakota as part of the celebration of the state's 125 years of statehood (November 2, 2014).
                        p
                            |The idea of this multidisciplinary project was conceived by Dr. Michael Niedzielski who also leads the project  with support from Dr. Debbie Storrs, Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, and Michael Jacobs, former publisher of the Grand Forks Herald. During 2014-2015, support was also provided by Dr. Tami Carmichael (Integrated Studies), while during 2015-2016  support was provided by Dr. Bradley Rundquist (Administrative Fellow in the College of Arts and Sciences and Professor of Geography).

                        p
                            |The purpose of the atlas is to engage an interdisciplinary group of students in experiential and collaborative learning to map demographic, economic, and social changes across the state, interpreting such changes, and disseminating findings in a digital format. The atlas will provide several benefits:
                            ul
                                li It will be an important resource for policy makers, community members, and K-12 colleagues and students.
                                li It will expand students' educational experiences through experiential and collaborative learning with significant community engagement and impact.
                                li It will provide a tangible product for public consumption to increase participation of the public as informed citizens.

Each group is responsible for telling the story of a chosen theme through maps, graphs and narratives. The project is also supported by a group of students taking Dr. Desell’s Capstone course in Computer Science who work on the technical design of the interactive atlas.

                                |Our biggest challenges will be developing a user interface that is consistent for multiple devices and screen sizes, including phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops and integrating existing technologies and algorithms to allow for the dynamic elements of the atlas.
                                |By creating a content management system, our application can be extended to further projects and allow other schools or organizations to create their own online atlas.

                                |During the Summer 2015 semester progress was made on the atlas project on several fronts. First, the Anthropology students, Cheyenne Paris and Patrick Sprague, continued interviewing local residents about their ethnic self-identity, transcribing them and developing a narrative from them. Second, Marshall Mattingly continued work on the web development. Third, Karl Bauer and Jay Sandeen, with assistance from Jacob Garibay, continued work on data collection and map design for the project.
