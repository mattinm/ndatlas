	h2(id="title0") The Title look me up 
	div(id="content")
		div(class="section") Long before the Europeans started to migrate over into this area there were many American Indian groups that resided in modern-day North Dakota. These groups included the Mandan, Hidatsa, Arikara, the Ojibwe and Cree, and the numerous groups of the Sioux tribe #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Yankton, Yanktonai, Teton, Santee") [3]]. A variety of other ethnic groups also migrated to this area with the purpose of staking claim to land. These groups largely consisted of either French-Canadian fur traders that migrated down the Missouri River and from areas of Northern Minnesota, Central Canada, and from the Eastern region of the United States.
		div(class="section") The clashing of land claim presented a problem for the American Indians and the recent migrants to the area over who had a right to the farmlands. It is said that these disputes over land, among other political conflicts, led to the Sioux Wars that lasted for almost half a century, where battles such as Little Bighorn and Wounded Knee took place #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Waldman 191")[4]]. There were many native casualties due to the use of gun power by militant forces, as well as the spread of diseases, such as small pox. However, this was not a determiner of all battles fought.
		div(class="section") In 1858, General J.B.S Todd, and other members of the United States Army created a treaty that relocated many of the area’s tribes to designated regions. The Mandan, the Hidatsa and the Arikara were relocated to Fort Berthold; many Siouan tribes were relocated to the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, the Santee tribe to the Turtle Mountain Reservation and the Ojibwe to Spirit Lake Reservation.
		div(class="section") Congress created a bill in 1861 that was signed by President James Buchanan, which organized the surrounding lands as the Dakota Territory #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Foster 1928:7-8")[5]]. When many new settlers began to migrate towards the area with the prospect of finding gold in areas of Montana and South Dakota, tensions again began to rise between the Native Americans and the new area settlers. This led to the establishment of Army forts along the Missouri River. Then in 1876, Lieutenant Colonel George A. Custer led the 7th Cavalry from Fort Abraham Lincoln, in present-day Mandan, North Dakota, to fight off the Sioux, Arapaho, and Cheyenne tribes in Montana at the Battle of the Little Big Horn. Custer and the entire 7th Calvary were annihilated in the battle and it is still considered one of the greatest victories of the time  #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Waldman 191")[6]]. The Sioux wars ended in 1890 with the Battle of Wounded Knee in South Dakota. There were a great many American Indian causalities, which led to the end of the wars  #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Waldman 196")[7]].
	h2 The Dakota Homestead 
	div(id="content") 
		div(class="section") The United States Federal government officially organized the Dakota Territory and appointed William Jayne as its first governor by President Lincoln in 1861 and a year later the territory was opened for homestead. When the Homestead Act of 1862 was passed a large number of settlers came the Dakota Territory to acquire land given out by the government. The Homestead Act allowed the possession of land as long as the land was farmed and sustained a plentiful crop, contributing to the food production for the nation. As the years progressed the Northern Pacific Railway (NPRR) and Great Northern Railway (GNRR), along with homesteaders increased the population of the northern Dakota Territory. In 1880 Military reserves were also opened for homestead in the eastern and central portion of the northern Dakota. By 1915 over seventy-nine percent of North Dakotas population were either immigrants or children of immigrants.
	h2 North Dakota’s Statehood: The Division of a Territory 
	div(id="content") 
		div(class="section") After population “boom” in the Dakota Territory because the homestead and the transcontinental railway, bills were summited for the addition of North and South Dakota into the union. On November 2, 1889, President Benjamin Harrison approved North and South Dakota’s statehood as the 39th and 40th states. It is said that President Harrison selected from the two bills at random for which to sign first because of the intense rivalry between the North and the South at the time. It was not recorded which he signed first. At its inception North Dakota was a republican state and its first governor, John Miller, fought popular issues of the time.
	h2 Norwegians
	div(id="content") 
		div(class="section") Of the many ethnicities that make up North Dakota Norwegian Americans make up a large portion of the population. There is not a real clear date as to when the first Norwegian settlers arrived, but many speculate that it was around 1860-1870 near the Wild Rice River in Cass County near what is now Abercrombie and Hickson, North Dakota  #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Sherman et al. 1988: 188")[1]]. So why are there such great numbers of Norwegian Americans in North Dakota? Some believe it was the unclaimed farmlands in the area that draw many from Minnesota and Iowa. There is also reason to believe that many Norwegians left Europe during mass democratic reform. Groups known for their “grass roots movement” removed themselves from the Old World and immigrated to America for change and expansion #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Sherman et al. 1988:185")[2]].
		div(class="section") Many Norwegians and Norwegian Americans migrated toward Devils Lake between 1883-1886 and eventually expanded out to present-day Benson and Bottineau. Benson was known as a Norwegian American population center and Bottineau was almost a solid concentration of Norwegian farmlands  #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Sherman et al. 1988:189")[3]]. In 1915, the North Dakota Board of Immigration went out of its way to invite more northern Europeans to the state.
		div(class="section") What is interesting to point out about the Norwegian population is that they have a sense of loyalty and cultural unity with one another. In 1885, the Scandinavian Temperance Society was organized with Swedish Americans and in 1889 the Scandinavian Republican League was formed to get voter recognition for Norwegian voters. Norwegian Americans also made a point to closely match their New World homes to that of Norway. The town of Northwood and surrounding towns were known as “halling towns”, referencing the region of Hollingal in Norway. Farmsteads of Cooperstown have also been known to show cultural similarities to the area of Stavanger in Norway #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Sherman et al. 1988:190")[4]].
		div(class="section") Even after many years the Norwegian culture still thrives in Norwegian communities. Poetry has shown to be a popular form of recording the early life of settlers in the state. Norwegian Americans in North Dakota are also one of the few ethnic groups in the state to memorialize themselves in statues. The 1970’s in North Dakota were a sort of cultural renaissance for Norwegian Americans. One of the many things to come out of this period was the reemergence of the Sons of Norway lodges such as the Hjemkomst Center in Fargo-Moorhead and the Sons of Norway lodge in Grand Forks. Gyde Vorden Lodge was the first Sons of Norway lodge to be founded in North Dakota in 1903. Many of these lodges were popular with Norwegian Americans for multiple years, however by the end of World War I the number of members began to dwindle. But in recent years membership has begun to increase. The Hostfest in Minot has also been a popular Norwegian cultural event that promotes much of the early immigrant’s culture and way of life through festival activities and music, such as performances by choral societies and fiddling.
	h2 Germans
	div(id="content") 
		div(class="section") In the early history of North Dakota there were many Germans that came to the state of North Dakota as trappers, explorers, and migrant workers before Germans settled permanently in the area. One of the earliest known German settlements in the state was the Selkrik Colony, which was comprised of forty-five German and Swiss migrants. In this group was the artist Peter Rindisbacher, possibly the first German artist to depict the North Dakota Indians #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Sherman et al. 1988:64")[1]]. In 1833, Alexander Philip Maximilian, a pioneer ethnographer, and Karl Bodmer, a painter, set out to explore the area, surveying the land and the people. A couple of years after the Civil War, Peter B. Davy along with a group of German immigrants followed suit surveying the upper Dakota Territory and by 1870 Germans began to create permanent residency in North Dakota #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Sherman et al. 1988:64-5")[2]].
		div(class="section") Much of reasoning behind German immigration was similar to other Western/Eastern European ethnic groups: political inequality, economic distress, and the want for freedom from oppressive governments. When the German immigrant groups finally made it over from Europe they joined up with the NPRR and church organizations to help to transition themselves into the newly founded state of North Dakota #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Sherman 1983:14")[3]].
		div(class="section") When World War I broke out in Europe, Germans were heavily persecuted throughout the state and became targets for suspicion. As their loyalty was questioned, many Germans decided to Americanize their names to avoid harassment and solidify their allegiance{cite:4}. There was even the talk, at the time, of changing the state capital Bismarck to something “less German”.
		div(class="section") Much like Norwegian Americans, German Americans also had different cultural groups and organizations. In 1881, one of the first German institutions was established in Jamestown; this group was the Jamestown Turnverein (named for Turnverein, a strenuous physical gymnastic exercise) #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Sherman et al. 1988:93-4")[5]]. Another group that became famous was the Sons of Hermann, named after a successful Roman officer from a Germanic tribe. This group was formed to preserve the culture and language of Germany. The first Sons of Hermann lodge was started in New Salem in 1907 #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Sherman et al. 1988:96")[6]]. The Schutzen Verein, another popular German organization, was a non-violent shooting society that performed drills and military maneuvers for festivals and celebrations.
	h2 Ukrainians
	div(id="content") 
		div(class="section") The Ukrainians who immigrated to America did so due to the poor conditions in the Ukraine at the time. There was widespread economic distress and many farmers were forced to sharecrop with neighboring nations like Russia and Poland. The first wave of immigrants from the Ukraine came around 1896 to Stark County in Western North Dakota. There was a steady stream of Ukrainian immigrants coming into the state up until 1912, spreading into Billings County.
		div(class="section") Ukrainians tend to be split geographically between different religious practices. Western Ukrainians are more involved with the Uniate Catholic Church or Greek Orthodox, while Eastern Ukrainians are usually from Protestant groups. These religious groups were important to maintaining cultural heritage when immigrants began to settle in homesteads in North Dakota.
	h2 Native Americans
	div(id="content") 
		div(class="section") Before the establishment of the reservations, life for the Native Americans was organized and integrated to protect, nurture and help individuals to help overcome the hardships of living in the prairie #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Schneider 1990:24")[1]]. Even before the arrival of the Lewis and Clark expedition, the Europeans have made a devastating impact on the American Indians. Many products like horses, guns and steel tools really reshaped how the Native Americans lived and interacted with other tribes. Horses from New Mexico for example made buffalo hunting much easier and migrating to new lands quicker. Many of these goods however came at a significant cost. As many of the Native Americans were becoming fonder of goods such as cloth, vermillion, glass beads and other goods, it led to overhunting buffalo for trade goods and increased tribal warfare #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Schulenberg 1956:81")[2]].
		div(class="section") The American government made an assault on the Native Americans to force them to abandon their “savagery” and to become “civilized” the passing of legislations like the Indian Civilization Act of 1819 and Indian Territory Act of 1830 #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Gagnon 2009:169")[3]]. The Dawes Allotment Act of 1887 was also another devastating blow to the American Indian culture. This act, forced them to abandon the common usage of the tribal land and force them to become private landowners #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Gagnon 2009:170") [4]].
		div(class="section") Even through many of the hardships that the Native American community endured, their rich cultural traditions continue to live on. Many of their traditional ceremonies were integrated into American holidays like the Fourth of July #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Braun 2009:180")[5]]. This American Indians also adapted Christianity into many of the religious practices #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Braun 2009:180")[6]]. This tended to annoy the missionaries in the area because they believed it undermined their efforts to convert them.
		div(class="section") The Native Americans are considered one of the oldest ethnic groups to inhabit the Americas. In the state of North Dakota there are multiple tribes with a varying degree of cultural practices, beliefs and languages. There are the Gardening Tribes, which consist of the Arikara, Hidatsa, and Mandan; the Seven Council Fires that include the Dakota, Lakota, Yankton and Yanktonai; and the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa. This supplemental text will serve as a brief overview for the three Siouan tribes of the Dakota, Lakota and the Nakota. We will also look at the early history of the Standing Rock Reservation, which encompasses both Sioux County, North Dakota and Corson County, South Dakota.
	h2 The Sioux 
	div(id="content") 
		div(class="section") The name Sioux is one that is commonly known in this part of the country. What many people may not know is that the Sioux comprise of many different tribal groups including the Dakota, Teton, Yankton and Yanktonai. Each of these groups make up different Siouan dialect regions throughout the surrounding area, all of the divisions of Siouan speakers were originally known as Oceti Sakowin or Seven Council Fires. This council refers to their seven political structures: the Western group Teton; the Eastern group of Sisseston, Wahpeton, Wahpekut and Mdwakouton; and the Central group of Yankton and Yanktonai #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Pritzker 1998:452")[1]]. The band chiefs and clan leaders of these tribes met annually with other members of the Seven Council Fires to socialize and discuss matters of importance. The name “Sioux” is believed to have derived from the Chippewa word Nadouessioux, meaning “adders” or “lesser enemy.” #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Waldman 2009:191")[2]]. Even though the name Sioux is commonly used in historical and anthropological literature when describing these tribal groups, many view this as a very derogative term #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="O’Leary and Levinson 1991:349")[3]]. However, other tribes have different meanings to the name, for example the Dakota(another Siouan tribe) translate the meaning as “ally” or “free people” #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Pritzker 1998:452")[4]].
	h2 The Dakota
	div(id="content") 
		div(class="section") Many of the Dakota tribes varied among one another. Some were more suited for the subsistence farming of corn, squash and beans along the rivers while other tribes were more suited for hunting. The deer and buffalo were major food animals for the Dakota as well as rabbits and muskrats. The gathering of food resources strongly influenced the lifestyle of the tribe all year long. In autumn, deer hunting parties would go out to gather meats to dry for the winter. When winter came, muskrats were hunted in place of deer and the sugar processing occurred. Then in the summer, planting and berry picking was practiced until harvest time and the process began all over again when fall came again #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Schneider 1994:80")[1]].
		div(class="section") Many of the Dakota tribes were organized in political structure of permanent villages. Many did not split into multiple hunting parties as much like the Lakota and structured under a hereditary chieftainship as long as the successor qualified. If the individual does not qualify, usually a council would convene and appoint a new chief #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Schneider 1994:80")[2]].
		div(class="section") The religion of the Dakota was a complex system known as Wakan Tanka. In this belief, man and nature were not viewed as competing forces, but rather as elements in the same system #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Schneider 1994:81")[3]]. The Dakota were also known to practice two major ceremonies known as the Medicine Dance and the Sun Dance. In the Medicine Dance, people are initiated into the ability to cure and to the sacred mysteries of the medicine men #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Schneider 1994:82")[4]]. The version of the Sun Dance practiced by the Dakota is much more informal than what is practiced by the Lakota. This would be due to the fact that many Dakota did not generally believe in self-sacrificing. If they did practice the self-sacrificing aspect, enduring the pain of the Sun Dance prepared them for the pain of life that would come as a medicine man or warrior #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Schneider 1994:82")[5]].
	h2 The Lakota 
	div(id="content") 
		div(class="section") Many believed that the Lakota originated from the Black Hills from South Dakota. However due to the archaeological records and oral traditions, the origins of Lakota claim that they migrated out of Minnesota in the 1600's #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Schneider 1994:82")[1]]. Unlike the Dakota, the Lakota were generally a mobile tribe that migrated constantly across the plains. They lived in non-permanent settlements known as tiospaye, or camps. Each of these tiospaye were further divided into smaller camps that represented extended family #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Schneider 1994:82")[2]]. The tipis and other similar structures represented the nuclear family for the Lakota, and followed a strict etiquette when living in the tipi. Women sat on the left of the door, while men sat on the right. A place of honor was reserved for guests facing the door of the tipi, and no one passed between the fire and a person sitting by the fire #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Schneider 1994:82")[3]].
		div(class="section") A major food source for the Lakota was the buffalo. Many ceremonies were conducted in honor of the buffalo such as worshiping the White Buffalo Cow Woman, which was an important religious figure that brought the sacred pipe and the seven ceremonies to the Lakota. As part of their religious practices, which included worshipping the great spirit of Wakantanka, they recognized that too much of any good thing was bad. They wanted to bring balance to the universe, and in order to do that they practiced the seven ceremonies which included: the sweat lodge, keeping the ghost, seeking a vision, sun dancing, making relatives, preparing a girl for womanhood and the sacred pipe ceremony #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Schneider 1994:83")[4]].
		div(class="section") The Sun Dance was very integral to the Lakota. This was a four-day ceremony filled with dances and prayers seeking continuation of the buffalo and safety of the people. This ceremony was very controversial to Euro-Americans because they believed that the self-sacrificing aspect of piercing one skin with skewers tied to poles was torture imposed on their youth, but actually represented a way of restoring harmony to the universe as well as provide strength to their people and secure the protection of the sacred beings #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Schneider 1994:85")[5]].
	h2 The Nakota: Yankton and Yanktonai 
	div(id="content") 
		div(class="section") The Nakota is the Central group that includes the Yankton (“end village”) and Yanktonai (“little end village”). Scholars believe that these groups resided along the north-end of the Mississippi River extending even as far as Texas. The Yankton and Yanktonai were originally one tribe. But due conflicts with the Cree and Ojibwa as well as migrating buffalo to the plains, they are believed to have separated near Leech Lake in the late 17th Century. The Yankton moved towards the pipestone quarries of the Southeast, while the Yanktonai left Mille Lacs by the early 18th century to follow the Teton tribe who were going west #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Pritzker 1998:490")[1]]. 
		div(class="section") The Yanktonai were also divided between each other as well. The Upper Yanktonai were consisted of six different bands, and the Hunkpatina(Lower Yanktonai) had seven bands. The Lewis and Clark Expedition located this group along the headwaters of the Sioux, James, and Red Rivers #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Schulenberg 1956:23")[2]]. Many Yankton and Yanktonai have achieved success as artists #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Pritzker 1998:491")[3]].
	h2 Standing Rock Reservation 
	div(id="content") 
		div(class="section") Standing Rock Reservation is one of the largest reservations in land area, but not in population #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Schneider 1994:147")[1]]. Early in its establishment from the Treaty of Fort Laramie in 1851, Standing Rock was part of the Great Sioux Nation. The Great Sioux Nation originally included all of South Dakota that was west of the Missouri River, part of western North Dakota, eastern Montana and Wyoming, and western Nebraska. Then in 1868 the land was reduced to all of South Dakota west of the Missouri River.
		div(class="section") The Lakota were strongly opposed to the intrusion of white settlers and soldiers in their land, so many took up arms and began what was to be known as the “Sioux Wars” which took place during five different periods, which included events such as the Battle of Little Big Horn and Battle of Wounded Knee. The U.S. government held the Lakota responsible for the acts claiming that they violated the treaty; this led to further division and separation of the Great Sioux Nation #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Schneider 1994:148")[2]].
		div(class="section") Most of the reservations residents were tribal members of the Yanktonai, Hunkpapa, Ogala and other smaller groups. From 1906 to 1915 the U.S. began the process of land allotment for those looking to set up farmlands and residencies in North Dakota; this led to even further loss of land for the Native Americans. By the late 20th Century, Standing Rock Reservation contained roughly 847,799 acres, 300,000 of which are tribally owned #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Pritzker 1998:479")[3]]. The Standing Rock Reservation has a history of maintaining cultural integrity relative isolation by resisting federal funds. Many members, such as the Deloria family, have achieved national and international prominence as writers, teachers, activists and leaders #[a(href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" title="Pritzker 1998:491")[4]].
	h2 Where Do We Go From Here?
	div(id="content") 
		div(class="section") From the general research and ethnic specific information we have collected on North Dakota, we are looking forward to expanding our working in the semester to come. With an emphasis on self-identity we hope to uncover cultural tradition, family histories, and ethnic change, which will add to our story of the history and change of North Dakota for its 125th anniversary. With the help of Dr. Reed, we plan on traveling to many locations in North Dakota for our research. The goal is to be able to interview multiple members of a single family who have all remained life-long residents of North Dakota, to more easily chart change from the 1950’s to present-day. We plan on video and voice recording the interviews in the hopes of including them on the interactive site.
		div(class="section") As a group, we are very interested in the role of self-identity in collecting and interpreting ethnic based data. As time passes and later generations begin to move further from their ancestral roots ideas of self begin to shift and change. There are many factors that contribute to one’s own self-identity: place, religion, schooling, and family traditions, to name a few. Self-identity is not something that is easy to measure because classification can be so person specific. We hope to have a deeper look into self-identity and better understand what informs self-identity for some residents of North Dakota. With the state’s rich history of immigration and with many recent immigrant groups, we see a wealth of potential in this project, which can hopefully be added to long after our work is completed.
